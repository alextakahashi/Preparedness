# Emergency Preparedness App

Helping families stay prepared in preparations for emergencies or natural disasters.

## Main Idea

Allow a user to specify various things (foodstuffs, equipment, etc.) to prepare for a disaster. Items can be added with reminders and expiration dates to ensure that items are always fresh and ready to use.

## Main Features

- Suggest items needed to prepare for some common emergencies/disasters
- Items can have expiration dates, app will remind user that item needs to be maintained/ replaced
- User can take notes/make list of steps to follow in an emergency - so these can be rehearsed ahead of time
- Offline possibility
- Keyword: “Your Emergency Bag”

### Family Plan

- When a disaster happens, this is what we as a family will do (maybe)
- All family members should have access to this and be able to edit
- Things the plan should have:
  - 2 location to meet at home, and one further away
  - One can be ex. Across the street
    - The other should be further away in case the neighborhood is not safe
    - 2 Phone number to call (relative out of state?) Essentially emergency contact
- Family plan should be print friendly

### Emergency Kit

- Separated by adult, kids, senior, disability, pets
- To go bag for individual
- An emergency kit that is set in place for the entire family

### Extreme Heat

- Cooling shelters

### Maps

- Live maps (what exactly do we show on there?)
